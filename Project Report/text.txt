# PROJECT REPORT
School Library Management System (Python + MySQL)

Student Name: Rimi
Class: 12
Subject: Computer Science
School: [add if needed]

## 1. Introduction
The Library Management System is a menu-driven Python project designed to computerize the daily operations of a library.
This system helps librarians manage books, maintain records of issued and returned books, and update data in real time using a MySQL database.

The project demonstrates the use of:
Python programming
MySQL database operations
CRUD operations
Exception handling
Menu-driven interaction

## 2. Objective of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:
To manage library books efficiently using a MySQL database
To store and update details of issued and returned books
To reduce manual errors
To provide an easy-to-use interface for librarians
To demonstrate Python–MySQL connectivity

## 3. Problem Definition
Traditional library record-keeping relies heavily on registers and manual updates, which may result in:
Errors in tracking book quantities
Difficulty identifying issued and available books
Slow operations
Lack of a centralized system
This project solves these problems by storing all information digitally and automating updates.

## 4. System Requirements
### Software Requirements:
Python 3
MySQL Server
MySQL Connector for Python (mysql-connector-python)
Any IDE (VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE)

### Hardware Requirements
Laptop or PC
Minimum 4GB RAM
Stable MySQL installation

## 5. Methodology / Approach
### Step 1: Database Creation
A database library_1 is created with two tables:
available_books
issued

### Step 2: Establish Python-MySQL Connection
Using:
import mysql.connector as mysql

### Step 3: Designing the Menu
A menu-driven interface allows the user to:
Add books
Remove books
Issue and return books
View all books
View issued books

### Step 4: CRUD Operations
The program uses SQL queries to perform:
✔ INSERT — When adding a book or issuing a book
✔ DELETE — When removing a book or returning it
✔ UPDATE — When updating book quantities
✔ SELECT — To display records

### Step 5: Input Validation & Error Handling
The program ensures:
ID must be numeric
Existing IDs cannot be duplicated
Issuing is possible only if quantity > 0
Correct student and book details are entered

## 6. Implementation Details
Tables Used
->available_books
Column Name	Type	Description
b_id	INT	Book ID
b_name	VARCHAR(50)	Book title
subject	VARCHAR(50)	Category
quantity	INT	Available copies
->issued
Column Name	Type	Description
id	INT	Book ID
b_name	VARCHAR	Name of book
s_name	VARCHAR	Student name
s_class	VARCHAR	Student class

## 7. Results & Analysis
After implementation, the system successfully performed:
Efficient book tracking
Smooth issuing and returning
Instant updates to quantities
Accurate record maintenance
Zero data inconsistency
The project demonstrates strong understanding of both Python and SQL connectivity.

## 8. Conclusion
This project successfully automates library operations and reduces dependency on manual record-keeping.

It demonstrates:
Python’s capability for database applications
MySQL integration
Menu-driven programming
Error handling and validation
The system is user-friendly, fast, and reliable. Additional features like GUI and due-date calculation can be added in the future.

## 9. Future Enhancements
The project can be extended by adding:
GUI using Tkinter/PyQt
Due-date & fine calculation
Admin login system
Exporting reports to PDF
Search functionality
